    Thank you for using Purchase Splitter Bot! If you came here, because you were invited to someone else's checklist, you can now head back to their invite message and click the button.

    The button you tried to press is not valid. There could be a couple of reasons:

    1) The bot server just rebooted. Ongoing actions are canceled on reboot, so just try again whatever you just did.
    2) You tried to start an action which is already in progress. This is not possible, so you will have to look through your chat history, find the ongoing action and click the *Back to Main Menu* button.
    3) The bot server is bugged.

      Purchase Splitter Bot can help you manage group purchases.

      *ATTENTION*: At the moment, there is neither logging nor notifications for what the participants of a checklist are doing. This means the bot can be easily exploited. You should NOT use this bot for serious matters. It is meant as a convenience tool for people that trust each other.

      The intended workflow is as follows:

      - Create a checklist and invite people
      - Add items which you want to buy and use as group
      - Have someone in the group buy (some of) the desired items
      - If the checklist is meant to be temporary (i.e. buying items like food and gas for a road trip), write off the purchases after the time is up
      - If the checklist is meant to be permanent (i.e. buying items for a common household), write off the purchases in regular intervals
      - Track/pay off debt between users

      For detailed information about the individual steps, refer to the corresponding topic.

      If you want to track the development of this bot or ask questions, head to https://github.com/hildebro/moneysplitter
  checklist:
    link: Checklists
    text: |
      *Checklists*:

      Checklists are the core of Purchase Splitter Bot. Anything you do is in relation to a checklist.

      In order to switch the active checklist or create a new one, go to _Checklist settings > Checklist picker_
      You may create as many checklist as you want as long as they have unique names.

      In order to add other telegram users to your checklist, go to _Checklist settings > Invite users_
  item:
    link: Items
    text: |
      *Items*:

      Every checklist holds a list of items.

      New items can be added by sending a message to the bot. In order to add multiple items in a single message, use newlines to separate them.

      Items can be deleted by going to _Checklist settings > Drop items_

      The items of a checklist are displayed in the main menu. The item list is refreshed whenever you enter the main menu, but you may also press _Refresh items_ to do it explicitly.

      The sole purpose of an item in a checklist is to be purchased.
  purchase:
    link: Purchases
    text: |
      *Purchases*:

      A purchase consists of two steps:
      1) _Select items to purchase_
      You may add new items to the checklist during the selection process. If the purchase is aborted, any items you added will still be present in the list.
      Multiple users may create a purchase at the same time. The bot ensures that items aren't purchased redudantly.

      2) _Set price of purchased items_
      In order to set the price, you simply send a message containing the appropriate number. You may define cents by using either a comma or a dot to seprate them.
      Currencies are not implemented in any way.

      After setting a price, the purchase is finalized. The button _Unresolved purchases_ let's you inspect details of any purchase that hasn't been written off yet.
  write_off:
    link: Write-Off
    text: |
      *Write-Off*:

      Purchases that are listed under _Unresolved purchases_ can be written off. The process of _writing off_ involves the following steps:

      - Clear the list of unresolved purchases
      - Calculate how much money the users of the checklist owe each other
      - Populate the _Balances_ menu to reflect the debt between users

      The debt between users doesn't need to be cleared before writing off again. The existing amounts will be updated accordingly.

      Write-offs are permanent. ALL unresolved purchases will be removed, so handle this action with care.
  balance:
    link: Balances
    text: |
      *Balances*:

      _Balances_ show you any debt that you are involved with; both the money you owe and being owed.

      Note that you cannot send money via the bot. You need to be in contact with the other users to figure out how to resolve your debt.

      After money has been transferred, you should document it by using _Resolve debts_ in the balances menu.
