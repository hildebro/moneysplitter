Telegram bot to manage group purchases.

Current features:
- Shared shopping list
- Interactive purchases
- Purchase history
- Debt calculation based on past purchases
- User-to-User balances to keep track of debt
- Assigning (partial) cost of purchases to specific users

I'm no longer working on this repo, because the limitations of Telegram's bot API has been very irritating. I'm planning to convert this code into a webapp at some point.
