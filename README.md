# moneysplitter (abandoned)
Telegram bot to manage group purchases.

Features:
- Shared shopping list
- Interactive purchases
- Purchase history
- Debt calculation based on past purchases
- User-to-User balances to keep track of debt
- Assigning (partial) cost of purchases to specific users

I'm no longer working on this repo, because the limitations of Telegram's bot API have been very irritating. I'm planning to rewrite moneysplitter as a webapp at some point.
