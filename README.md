I'm no longer working on new features, because the limitations of Telegram bots are very annoying to deal with. I'm still using the bot myself, so I will deliver fixes for breaking changes that may come in the future.
Anyone can host an instance of this bot, but I didn't write any documentation on how to get it up and running. Theoretically, all you have to do is run `bin/setup.sh` and then run `main.py`. But that script was made for my personal setup with Arch Linux, so it won't work for everyone.
If anyone out there actually wants to run this themselves, feel free to contact me and I'll help you out, if I got time to spare.
